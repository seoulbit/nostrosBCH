# Getting Started with NostrosCash

This is a fork of the Nostros project that will have two main goals:

* remove all Lightning Network functionality
* add support for payments (micro and macro) using the BCH network

after that support for other coins will be implimented. BTC, LTC and ARRR(Pirate Coin) are on the list
